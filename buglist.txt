addBack()
	Seems like it has the same code that addFront() has, aka it actually adds elements to the front.

removeBack()
removeFront()
	These two functions do not actually remove elements. They do return false that they did
	not remove stuff, but they should have removed them.

isEmpty()
	Returns true when there are elements in the list.
